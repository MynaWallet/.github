# MynaWallet


## Project Overview

MynaWallet enables users to operate ERC-4337-compliant contract accounts using their Myna Card, a personal identification card issued by the Japanese government. With a simple tap of their Myna Card, users can seamlessly make token payments, transfer/receive NFTs, and execute any transaction supported by their contract accounts. This R&D will provide a user-friendly platform for secure cryptocurrency transactions, fostering the growth of the Ethereum ecosystem in Japan and encouraging further innovation and inclusion.
